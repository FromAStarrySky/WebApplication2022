README file on this project

Anything that is believed to be above and beyond?

- Not that I know of but I am really happy that I was able to figure out how to implement jQuery features after struggling with it
in the previous project.

- It was easy to implement and calling multiple functions for instance:
  - Getting BOTH undergrad and graduate degrees under the same Model Degree.
  - Getting BOTH tables of Employment and Co-op under the same Model Employment.
  - Getting BOTH faculty and staff under the same Model Faculty.
